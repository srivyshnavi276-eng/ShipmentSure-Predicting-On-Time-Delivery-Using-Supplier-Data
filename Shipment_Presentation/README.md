🚚 ShipmentSure: Predicting On-Time Delivery Using Supplier Data

ShipmentSure is a machine learning-based logistics prediction system designed to estimate whether a shipment will be delivered on time or delayed. It uses supplier-related and shipment-specific features to provide accurate predictions and confidence scores.

The system is built with a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard featuring a professional black-gold interface, making it easy to interact with and visualize results.

📌 Key Features
Predicts delivery status (On-Time or Delayed)
Uses supplier and shipment-related data for analysis
Interactive and easy-to-use Streamlit dashboard
Displays prediction results along with confidence levels
Clean and professional black-gold user interface
Modular and well-structured project design
🗂️ Project Structure
train_model.py → Responsible for training the machine learning model
app.py → Main application file (handles UI and prediction flow)
utils.py → Contains helper functions for preprocessing and predictions
style.css → Defines UI styling
.streamlit/config.toml → Manages Streamlit theme settings
requirements.txt → Lists all required dependencies
⚙️ Installation
Download or clone the project repository to your system
Navigate to the project folder

🚀 Execution Process
Step 1: Model Training

First, run the training script to build and save the machine learning model.
This step prepares the system by learning patterns from historical shipment data.

Step 2: Launch the Application

After training the model, start the Streamlit application.
This will automatically open a web-based dashboard in your browser.

Step 3: Provide Input

Enter shipment-related details such as supplier information, distance, or other required parameters in the dashboard.

Step 4: Get Prediction

Click on the prediction button to view the result.
The system will display:

Delivery status (On-Time or Delayed)
Confidence level of the prediction
🧠 Working Principle

The system works in the following stages:

Collects supplier and shipment data
Preprocesses the input data using helper functions
Applies a trained machine learning model
Generates prediction results
Displays the outcome in an interactive dashboard
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
Data Processing (Pandas, NumPy)
Streamlit (for web interface)
CSS (for UI design)
📈 Future Enhancements
Integration with real-time logistics data
GPS-based tracking features
Advanced analytics and visualization
Improved model accuracy using deep learning
👩‍💻 Project Purpose

This project is developed to improve logistics efficiency by predicting delivery delays in advance. It helps organizations make better decisions, optimize supply chains, and enhance customer satisfaction.
